from the culture of a tissue-biopsy specimen.","It is emphasized that Crohn's disease is very rare in the Black population of sub-Saharan Africa, and, as far as we are aware, no patient with large-bowel involvement has hitherto been reported.","Several large series of ulcerative colitis patients are reviewed to emphasize the important concomitant cutaneous findings, and investigations into the pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum are discussed.","Large granular lymphocytic leukemia refers to a clonal expansion of lymphocytes that have abundant cytoplasm and azurophilic granules. [...] We describe a patient with large granular lymphocytic leukemia, which was confirmed by molecular genetics studies, who had a pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcer on his leg. [...] Results of an evaluation of the histologic characteristics and the leukocytic immunophenotype of a skin biopsy specimen from the ulcer demonstrated large granular lymphocytes within the blood vessels. [...] Cutaneous ulceration may be a manifestation of large granular lymphocytic leukemia, and this disease should be considered when diagnosing patients with otherwise unexplained pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcers of the skin.","A 56-year-old female with an eight-year history of corticosteroid therapy for rheumatoid arthritis presented with large, deep, painful ulcers on the left buttock and thigh.","Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) denotes several types of gastrointestinal disorders characterized by protracted inflammation of the large or small bowel, and a tendency toward relapse or recurrence.","Symptoms suggestive of Raynaud's syndrome were noted in 11 patients (14%) and could be directly related to large vessel involvement.","Associated illnesses--most commonly a seronegative arthritis affecting large joints--were present in 55 per cent and 92 per cent of cases respectively.","Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare chronic and recurrent skin disease characterized by progressing lesions from papulopustules to large necrotic sterile ulcers.","A 21-year-old man, with a past history of severe aphthosis and arthritis between age 5 and 15 years, presented at age 18 years with a large leg ulceration, which developed after minor trauma.","The skin lesions consisted of small discrete ulcers on the back and head and large punched-out ulcers on the legs.","The treatment of choice was large doses of steroids and control of his ulcerative colitis.","Pulse therapy with large doses of corticosteroids resulted in dramatic clinical improvement.","Histopathological examination of the spleen (removed at operation) and of tissue from a duodenal biopsy (taken postoperatively) showed large numbers of striations and outlines suggestive of crystal deposition.","The smaller ulcers healed spontaneously, but skin grafting had to be performed for the large ulcer.","In vesiculobullous conditions, although the primary lesions are blisters, observed abnormalities may include large, flaccid bullae (pemphigus vulgaris), superficial crusted erosions (pemphigus foliaceus), or erythema multiforme-like lesions (paraneoplastic pemphigus). [...] Papulosquamous conditions are characterized by small (papules) or large (plaques) raised skin lesions and are usually associated with solid tumors.","Cyclosporin has also been evaluated in a large range of disorders where immunoregulatory dysfunction is a suspected or proven aetiological factor, and this is the focus of the present review.","Although initial biopsies in this patient resembled polyarteritis nodosa, subsequent biopsies exhibited more characteristic changes and immunohistochemical stains confirmed the diagnosis of large cell angiocentric cutaneous T cell lymphoma.","Cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes are a large group of dermatoses that may be associated with an internal malignancy.","A markedly obese 54 year old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, anaemia, dyspepsia, controlled hypothyroidism and depression presented with a seven month history of large pyoderma gangrenosum ulcers on the shins.","We present a patient with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who developed multiple large, painful ulcers that were scattered over his anterior lower legs and were characteristic of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG).","Immunophenotypic analysis has revealed that most cases are a form of anaplastic large-cell Ki-1-positive (CD30+) lymphoma. [...] We describe two patients with Ki-1-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma that had clinical and pathologic features of regressing atypical histiocytosis and mimicked benign dermatoses (pyoderma gangrenosum and morphea), causing a delay in confirming the true diagnosis. [...] The index patient and second patient were diagnosed as having Ki-1-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma by immunophenotyping and underwent cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone, and vincristine (CHOP) chemotherapy with complete remission. [...] Studies on paraffin-embedded tissue were consistent with Ki-1-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.

[...] As diagnosis is made, largely, on the basis of exclusion the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum may be unduly delayed.","We present a rarely reported variant of this in a 44-year-old woman with pyoderma gangrenosum and bilateral large purulent effusions of her knees.","Because PG is a rare disease, few large case series have been reported. [...] To augment that knowledge, we present our experience with a large number of patients over a significant time.","TA does not only involve large arteries, but also small blood vessels. [...] The observation that in TA the inflammatory process of the large arteries affects regions of the walls supplied by the vasa vasorum, the anatomy of which bears resemblance to the cutaneous vessel system, suggests that primary involvement of small vessels contributes to the development of the clinicopathological features of TA.","Objectives To document stoma-related skin disorders in a large cohort of patients.","The authors present their limited experience at the American University of Beirut with 4 patients who were controlled medically followed by skin grafting their large wounds, thus decreasing their morbidity and hospital stay.","The most common were arthralgias of the large joints (n = 146), of the sacroiliac joint (n = 59) and the small joints (n = 51). [...] Thromboembolic complications which are life-threatening, erythema nodosum and arthralgia of the small and large joints which impair quality of life, benefited the most from proctocolectomy.","Management of pyoderma gangrenosum continues to be a therapeutic challenge, both because the low incidence of the disease makes it difficult to conduct large-scale randomized studies and because pathogenic mechanisms are not yet well defined.","The records of 7 patients with pyoderma gangrenosum of the hand treated at 2 large academic medical centers between 1992 and 1999 were reviewed.","No large-scale, controlled trials have been conducted and, as a consequence, the knowledge of this condition is largely based on anecdotal reports.","Pyoderma vegetans is a rare condition that is clinically characterized by large verrucous plaques with elevated borders and multiple pustules.","On examination, the patient was found to have multiple umbilicated papules on her face, as well as painful, erythematous, large, punched-out ulcers on the nose, face, trunk, and extremities of 3 months' duration (Fig. [...] The largest ulcer on the left mandible was 4 cm in diameter.","We present the case of a 59-year-old woman who had large ulcerations on her right leg that were diagnosed initially as pyoderma gangrenosum and treated with three immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporin, prednisone and azathioprine) for 6 months.

[...] Surprisingly a histological evaluation of the ulcer revealed a CD30+ primary cutaneous large cell lymphoma, while histology of hypopigmented lesions revealed mycosis fungoides, patch stage. [...] Our case presents the rare coexistence of primary mycosis fungoides and primary CD30+ cutaneous large cell lymphoma, rather than the CD30+ cutaneous large cell lymphoma developing from mycosis fungoides. [...] This case also presents the development of a pyoderma gangrenosum-like lesion of CD30+ cutaneous large cell lymphoma in a patient with ulcerative colitis.","The lesions, of various shapes, comprised pustules and large bullous lesions on purple oedematous skin; these were painful and some were progressing to ulceration.","In our case, hyperbaric oxygen therapy associated with corticoids and immunosuppressants promoted healing of large and very painful lesions in an adolescent girl with an excellent outcome, including rapid wound closure and decreased discomfort.","A female child developed multiple, progressive, therapy-resistant, painful large ulcers, vesicles, and pustules since her 4 months of age.

[...] Recently, PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 mutations were shown to cause the syndrome of pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA), a dominantly inherited autoinflammatory disorder mediated predominantly by granulocytes. [...] Endogenous PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 and pyrin are coexpressed in monocytes and granulocytes and can be coimmunoprecipitated from THP-1 cells. [...] The B box segment of pyrin was necessary and the B box/coiled-coil segment sufficient for this interaction, whereas the SH3 and coiled-coil domains of PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 were both necessary, but neither was sufficient, for pyrin binding. [...] The Y344F PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 mutation, which blocks tyrosine phosphorylation, was associated with a marked reduction in pyrin binding in pervanadate-treated cells. [...] PAPA-associated A230T and E250Q PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 mutations markedly increased pyrin binding as assayed by immunoprecipitation and, relative to WT, these mutants were hyperphosphorylated when coexpressed with c-Abl kinase. [...] Consistent with the hypothesis that these mutations exert a dominant-negative effect on the previously reported activity of pyrin, we found increased IL-1beta production by peripheral blood leukocytes from a clinically active PAPA patient with the A230T PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 mutation and in cell lines transfected with both PAPA-associated mutants.","Currently, the database contains 291 sequence variants in related genes (MEFV, TNFRSF1A, MVK, CARD15, PSTPIP1, and CIAS1), consisting of published data and personal communications, which has revealed or refined the preferential mutational sites for each gene.","They demonstrated an interaction between pyrin and proline serine threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1), the protein involved in PAPA, and thus revealed a biochemical pathway common to both FMF and PAPA.","Within the refined region was the gene pstpip2, which shares significant sequence homology to the PSTPIP1. [...] Mutations in PSTPIP1 have been shown to cause the autoinflammatory disorder PAPA syndrome (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne).","PSTPIP1, mutated in the syndrome of pyogenic arthritis with pyoderma gangrenosum and acne, interacts both with pyrin and a protein tyrosine phosphatase to regulate innate and adaptive immune responses.","DNA samples from 97 patients with BD and 51 matched healthy controls were analysed for the mevalonate kinase (MVK), cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome 1 (CIAS1) and proline/serine/threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) genes, responsible for mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome, respectively. [...] PSTPIP1 analysis revealed a new exon 10 insertion variant (c.741+33_741+34insGT) in 2 of 97 patients and in 1 of 51 controls (p>0.05), indicating that it is a polymorphism rather than a true mutation. [...] This study could not demonstrate any significant increases in MVK, CIAS1 or PSTPIP1 mutations in patients with BD as compared with controls.","Interestingly, mutations in a PTP-PEST- and PTP-HSCF-interacting protein, PSTPIP1, were identified in humans with pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome and familial recurrent arthritis, two autoinflammatory diseases. [...] These mutations abrogate the ability of PSTPIP1 to bind PTP-PEST and PTP-HSCF, suggesting that these two PTPs may be negative regulators of inflammation.","PSTPIP1 is a cytoskeleton-associated adaptor protein that links PEST-type phosphatases to their substrates. [...] Mutations in PSTPIP1 cause PAPA syndrome (Pyogenic sterile Arthritis, Pyoderma gangrenosum, and Acne), an autoinflammatory disease. [...] PSTPIP1 binds to pyrin and mutations in pyrin result in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a related autoinflammatory disorder. [...] Since disease-associated mutations in PSTPIP1 enhance pyrin binding, PAPA syndrome and FMF are thought to share a common pathoetiology. [...] The studies outlined here describe several new aspects of PSTPIP1 and pyrin biology. [...] We document that PSTPIP1, which has homology to membrane-deforming BAR proteins, forms homodimers and generates membrane-associated filaments in native and transfected cells. [...] An extended FCH (Fes-Cip4 homology) domain in PSTPIP1 is necessary and sufficient for its self-aggregation. [...] We further show that the PSTPIP1 filament network is dependent upon an intact tubulin cytoskeleton and that the distribution of this network can be modulated by pyrin, indicating that this is a dynamic structure. [...] Finally, we demonstrate that pyrin can recruit PSTPIP1 into aggregations (specks) of ASC, another pyrin binding protein. [...] PSTPIP1 molecules with PAPA-associated mutations are recruited by pyrin to ASC specks with particularly high efficiency, suggesting a unique mechanism underlying the robust inflammatory phenotype of PAPA syndrome.","A hereditary autosomal dominant syndromic kind of pyoderma gangrenosum, the PAPA syndrome, is linked to mutations in the CD2BP1/PSTPIP1 gene. [...] The CCTG repeat in the PSTPIP1 promoter may play a role in the pathogenesis of AA and of CD.","PSTPIP1 is a cytoskeleton-associated adaptor protein that links PEST-type phosphatases to their substrates.","PAPA syndrome (Pyogenic Arthritis, Pyoderma gangrenosum, and Acne) is an autosomal dominant, hereditary auto-inflammatory disease arising from mutations in the PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 gene on chromosome 15q. [...] These mutations produce a hyper-phosphorylated PSTPIP1 protein and alter its participation in activation of the \"inflammasome\" involved in interleukin-1 (IL-1β) production.","It is caused by mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene and may be closely linked to the aseptic abscesses syndrome, which has been shown to be associated with CCTG repeat amplification in the promoter region of PSTPIP1. [...] Mutations in PSTPIP1 exons 1 to 15 were excluded.","Two mutations (A230T and E250Q) in the PSTPIP1 gene, encoding proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein (PSTPIP)1 have been identified in patients with PAPA (pyogenic sterile arthritis with PG and acne) syndrome, a rare autoinflammatory disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. [...] The aim of this study was to sequence PSTPIP1 complementary cDNA and genomic DNA for mutations, and to identify genetic polymorphisms in the promoter region of PSTPIP1 in patients with PG. [...] The genomic region and cDNA of the PSTPIP1 gene were sequenced from peripheral blood leucocytes of 14 patients with PG and 20 healthy controls. [...] One patient (PG1) had aberrant splicing variants of the PSTPIP1 transcript with deletions of exons 9, 11 and 12 and of exons 9-12 together, and all other patients with PG carried deletions of exon 11 and of 11-12. [...] We also identified a novel mutation (G258A) in patient PG3, and novel polymorphisms [(CCTG)(6) and (CCTG)(8) tandem repeats] in the promoter region of the PSTPIP1 gene. [...] All combinations of aberrant splicing variants had frame shifts and premature stop codons leading to truncated proteins and loss of function of PSTPIP1. [...] The (CCTG)(n) tandem repeats in the promoter region of PSTPIP1 had no association with PG. [...] The mutations G258A and R52Q are predicted by the improved prediction algorithm to have a possibly damaging effect on PSTPIP1 function.","PSTPIP1 (CD2BP1) exon 10 and exon 11 sequencing was performed in each patient. [...] We identified 2 previously described PAPA syndrome-associated PSTPIP1 mutations, A230T and E250Q, and a novel change, E250K. [...] This analysis of 5 patients demonstrates that mutations in PSTPIP1 are incompletely penetrant and variably expressed in the PAPA syndrome.","Inflammasomopathies are diseases with dysregulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and include CAPS with NLRP3, FMF with MEFV, and PAPAS with PSTPIP1 mutations.","PAPA syndrome is caused by mutations in a gene involved in the regulation of innate immune responses, the PSTPIP1, while no mutations have been detected to date in patients with PASH syndrome.","Mutations in the gene encoding proline serine threonine phosphatase-interacting protein-1 (PSTPIP1) have been linked to PAPA syndrome. [...] PSTPIP1 is an adaptor protein that interacts with PYRIN, the protein encoded by the Mediterranean Fever (MEFV) gene whose mutations cause Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). [...] However, the pathophysiological function of PSTPIP1 remains to be elucidated. [...] We have generated mouse strains that either are PSTPIP1 deficient or ectopically express mutant PSTPIP1. [...] Results from analyzing these mice suggested that PSTPIP1 is not an essential regulator of the Nlrp3, Aim2, or Nlrc4 inflammasomes. [...] Although common features of human PAPA syndrome such as pyogenic arthritis and skin inflammation were not recapitulated in the mouse model, ectopic expression of the mutant but not the wild type PSTPIP1 in mice lead to partial embryonic lethality, growth retardation, and elevated level of circulating proinflammatory cytokines.","It is associated with dominant missense mutations in the proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 gene (PSTPIP1) located on chromosome 15. [...] Sequencing of the PSTPIP1 gene was performed in the patient and his extended family. [...] The patient's DNA analysis revealed a homozygous nucleotide exchange c.773G>C in the PSTPIP1 gene, leading to the substitution of glycine 258 by alanine (p.Gly258Ala), a previously reported heterozygous polymorphism.","PSTPIP1 is a cytoskeletal adaptor and F-BAR protein that has been implicated in autoinflammatory disease, most notably in the PAPA syndrome: pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne. [...] However, the mechanism by which PSTPIP1 regulates the actin cytoskeleton and contributes to disease pathogenesis remains elusive. [...] Here, we show that endogenous PSTPIP1 negatively regulates macrophage podosome organization and matrix degradation. [...] We identify a novel PSTPIP1-R405C mutation in a patient presenting with aggressive pyoderma gangrenosum. [...] Identification of this mutation reveals that PSTPIP1 regulates the balance of podosomes and filopodia in macrophages. [...] The PSTPIP1-R405C mutation is in the SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain and impairs Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) binding, but it does not affect interaction with protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST. [...] Accordingly, WASP inhibition reverses the elevated F-actin content, filopodia formation, and matrix degradation induced by PSTPIP1-R405C. [...] Our results uncover a novel role for PSTPIP1 and WASP in orchestrating different types of actin-based protrusions. [...] Our findings implicate the cytoskeletal regulatory functions of PSTPIP1 in the pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum and suggest that the cytoskeleton is a rational target for therapeutic intervention in autoinflammatory disease.","Mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene have been identified in patients with pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne syndrome.","The mutation analysis of the boy identified a novel de novo mutation in PSTPIP1, the gene responsible for PAPA syndrome.","Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) is an adaptor protein associated with the cytoskeleton that is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells. [...] Mutations in PSTPIP1 cause the rare autoinflammatory disease called pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne. [...] We carried out this study to further our knowledge on PSTPIP1 function in T cells, particularly in relation to the phosphatase lymphoid phosphatase (LYP), which is involved in several autoimmune diseases. [...] LYP-PSTPIP1 binding occurs through the C-terminal homology domain of LYP and the F-BAR domain of PSTPIP1. [...] PSTPIP1 inhibits T-cell activation upon T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 engagement, regardless of CD2 costimulation. [...] This function of PSTPIP1 depends on the presence of an intact SH3 domain rather than on the F-BAR domain, indicating that ligands of the F-BAR domain, such as the PEST phosphatases LYP and PTP-PEST, are not critical for its negative regulatory role in TCR signaling. [...] Additionally, PSTPIP1 mutations that cause the pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne syndrome do not affect PSTPIP1 function in T-cell activation through the TCR.","We performed genetic analysis for PSTPIP1 mutations associated with PAPA syndrome.","Pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome is a rare hereditary, autosomal dominant, auto-inflammatory disease caused by mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene, which encodes proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1. [...] The fact that PSTPIP1 is involved in immune regulation provides a rationale for treatment of this rare disease with interleukin (IL)-1 signalling blocking agents. [...] We used direct sequencing to search for mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene. [...] Because of the known association of acne and pyoderma gangrenosum in PAPA syndrome, we determined the entire coding sequence of the PSTPIP1 gene, and identified a hitherto unreported heterozygous mutation predicted to alter a highly conserved residue (p.G403R) and to be damaging to the protein function. [...] We describe a novel mutation in PSTPIP1 resulting in pyoderma gangrenosum, acne and ulcerative colitis. [...] This novel constellation of clinical manifestations, which we term 'PAC syndrome', suggests the need to regroup all PSTPIP1-associated phenotypes under one aetiological group.","We report the case of a now 25-year-old male patient with PAPA syndrome with the E250K mutation in PSTPIP1. [...] We conducted a literature search of PubMed using the following search terms: E250K mutation, PSTPIP1, and PAPA. [...] PAPA syndrome is caused by mutations on chromosome 15q affecting the proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) gene, also known as CD2-binding protein 1 (CD2BP1).","Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) gene sequencing was performed in 14 patients with Hz/Hc, and their clinical phenotype was compared with that of 11 patients with pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome. [...] PSTPIP1-pyrin interactions were analyzed by means of immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. [...] A structural model of the PSTPIP1 dimer was generated. [...] Thirteen patients were heterozygous for a missense mutation in the PSTPIP1 gene, resulting in a p.E250K mutation, and 1 carried a mutation resulting in p.E257K. [...] Both mutations substantially alter the electrostatic potential of the PSTPIP1 dimer model in a region critical for protein-protein interaction. [...] Hz/Hc mutations altered protein binding of PSTPIP1, increasing interaction with pyrin through phosphorylation of PSTPIP1. [...] Mutations resulting in charge reversal in the y-domain of PSTPIP1 (E→K) and increased interaction with pyrin cause a distinct autoinflammatory disorder defined by clinical and biochemical features not found in patients with PAPA syndrome, indicating a unique genotype-phenotype correlation for mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene.","However, unlike other autoinflammatory diseases such as PAPA and PAPASH, we did not find mutations in the gene PSTPIP1, raising the possibility that other specific mutations in the IL-1 pathway may be involved.","In PAPA syndrome, different mutations involving the PSTPIP1 gene, via an increased binding affinity to pyrin, induce the assembly of inflammasomes. [...] Patients with PASH have recently been reported to present alterations of genes involved in well-known autoinflammatory diseases, such as PSTPIP1, MEFV, NOD2 and NLRP3.","Pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome is caused by mutations in the genes encoding proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1). [...] These PSTPIP1 mutants are thought to bind to pyrin causing an increase in the pyrin domain of apoptosis/speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) pyroptosome assembly leading to procaspase-1 recruitment and therefore its activation.","To give an overview about the expanding spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases due to mutations in proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) and new insights into their pathogenesis.

[...] Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha, has been approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease. [...] The anti-TNF-alpha properties of Infliximab suggest that healing may be mediated by the drug's effect on cytokine pathways, perhaps by blunted T cell activation early in the inflammatory cascade.","Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), decreasing the effect of the cytokine in inflammatory diseases. [...] The most promise lies in those diseases that have increased amounts of TNF-alpha in the cutaneous lesions, such as psoriasis.","Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) is involved in cell differentiation, mitogenesis, cytotoxic responses, inflammation, immunomodulation, and wound healing.

[...] The relative risk of legionellosis when receiving treatment with a TNF-alpha antagonist, compared with the relative risk in France overall, was estimated to be between 16.5 and 21.0. [...] L. pneumophila pneumonia is a potentially severe but curable infection that might complicate anti-TNF-alpha therapy. [...] In patients receiving anti-TNF-alpha who develop pneumonia, legionellosis should be systematically investigated, and first-line antibiotic therapy should be efficient against L. pneumophila.","A patient with inflammatory bowel disease developed severe pyoderma gangrenosum while receiving treatment with the chimeric anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab.

[...] The adverse effects associated with TNF-alpha inhibitors can generally be classified into those related to the target (or class) and those related to the agent. [...] Specific inhibition of TNF-alpha could also facilitate hepatotoxicity, production of autoantibodies, development of demyelinizing diseases and it is also possibly associated to the worsening of congestive heart failure. [...] Predisposition of infliximab-treated individuals, as occurs with other anti-TNF-alpha agents, to cause an increase of conventional pyogenic infections (of the skin and soft tissues, respiratory tract, genitourinary tracts and bacteriemias) and an increase in granulomatous and opportunistic infections due to invasive or intracellular pathogens (such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis), has been well established and quantified in the last five years. [...] We presently know that the initiation of screening strategies of latent infections (especially tuberculosis) in the host candidate to receive anti-TNF-alpha drugs, with their corresponding early treatment to avoid reactivations, and other prophylaxis, hygiene and vaccination measures have not only minimized these risks of suffering infections but also have practically reduced and equalized the different capacity to trigger infections belonging to each one of the biological agents individually.","In this article, we will focus on the clinical features, the pathogenesis related the genetic defects, and the therapeutic strategies in the representative disorders including familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), hyper-IgD with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS), syndrome of pyogenic arthritis with pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA), and Blau syndrome.","These include the crypyrinopathies, familial Mediterranean fever, TNF-receptor associated periodic fever syndrome (TRAPS), hyper-IgD and periodic syndrome (HIDS), pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome, NALP12-HPF, and the Blau syndrome.","Depending on the associated disease the treatment may vary from steroids to anti TNF biologics.","The association of HS with Crohn disease, psoriasis (PSO), and pyoderma gangrenosum, as well as the seronegative arthropathies, suggests a common immunopathogenesis and has motivated attempts at treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha agents, already demonstrated to be efficacious in major inflammatory diseases. [...] The success of anti-TNF agents such as infliximab in managing HS offers a new therapeutic option and supports an underlying immunologic basis for the disease.","TRAPS (TNF Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome), formerly known as Familial Hibernian Fever, is caused by a defective membrane receptor for TNF.","In particular tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockade has changed the treatment outcomes in moderate to severe psoriasis patients. [...] Some patients may develop infusion reactions, and dermatologists need to be well aware of any possible adverse events that may be associated with anti-TNF treatment.","We studied 21 patients with PG, eight with Sweet's syndrome and 20 controls, evaluating skin immunoreactivity for inflammatory cell markers (CD3, CD163 and myeloperoxidase), cytokines [tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-17], metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

[...] Patients with poorly controlled MKD, TRAPS, PAPA or FMF may benefit from IL-1 blockade; anti-TNF treatment may represent a possible valuable alternative.","The pathogenesis of PG has yet to be determined, but may be related to abnormal T cell responses and the production of TNF-α, a pathway also involved in IBD pathogenesis. [...] Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF-α, is used to treat moderate to severe IBD and several case reports and studies suggest the efficacy of infliximab in the treatment of PG.","TNF antagonists in ankylosing spondylitis and skin manifestations). [...] This review summarizes the conventional and novel (e.g. anti-TNF) treatment modalities, and the therapeutic implications for the management of extraintestinal symptoms in IBD, in order to assist clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies for IBD patients with EIM.","Tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-α) is a cytokine with a central role in inflammation.","The influence of gender, age, smoking habits, family history of inflammatory bowel disease, phenotype and previous anti-TNF treatment on EIM resolution was also investigated. at month six, 76.2% of the patients showed remission or response in CD (33.3% remission and 42.9% any response). [...] No relationship was found between sex, tobacco, family history of IBD, phenotype and previous treatment with anti-TNF, and EIM resolution. adalimumab is effective in reducing EIM of CD. [...] Age but not tobacco, CD phenotype and anti-TNF-naïve status appears to influence the response.","Anti-TNF-α agents such as etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab are used in refractory cases.","Novel biologics, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers and IL-1 inhibitors, appear promising in opposing the inflammation associated with SAPHO and PAPA syndromes, but it remains to seen if they can also improve severe acne particularly in the long term.","Aim of the study was to investigate the impact of TNF-α antagonists on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in selected skin diseases, i.e. chronic plaque psoriasis, Behçet's disease (BD), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). [...] Citations were screened for randomized, controlled trials of TNF-α antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) versus placebo in adults with psoriasis, BD, HS or PG. [...] TNF-α antagonists induced consistent benefits across health outcomes in psoriasis, but only monoclonal antibodies, infliximab and adalimumab were effective in improving QoL in patients with BD, HS and PG. [...] Generally, the burden on QoL was correlated to the severity of skin disease and the improvement in QoL achieved by TNF-α blockers was proportional to the degree of disease remission. [...] In general, achieving the highest clearing of skin disease with anti-TNF-α agents is required for optimal improvement in QoL.","The autoinflammatory diseases can be grouped based on clinical findings: 1. the three classic hereditary \"periodic fever syndromes\", familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF); TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS); and mevalonate kinase deficiency/hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS); 2. the cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), comprising familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) or CINCA, and; 3. pediatric granulomatous arthritis (PGA); 4. disorders presenting with skin pustules, including deficiency of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (DIRA); Majeed syndrome; pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome; deficiency of interleukin 36 receptor antagonist (DITRA); CARD14 mediated psoriasis (CAMPS), and early-onset inflammatory bowel diseases (EO-IBD); 5. inflammatory disorders caused by mutations in proteasome components, the proteasome associated autoinflammatory syndromes (PRAAS) and 6. very rare conditions presenting with autoinflammation and immunodeficiency.","In particular, in the last few years, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents have been successfully used to treat psoriasis, especially these kinds of lesions that may occur during the treatment with biological therapies. [...] This article reviews the therapeutic effects of the two most widely used anti-TNF-α molecules, infliximab (a fusion protein dimer of the human TNF-α receptor) and adalimumab (a fully human monoclonal antibody to TNF-α), for the treatment of the major cutaneous manifestations associated with IBD (EN, PG and psoriasis).","Anti-TNF therapy is also ineffective in treatment of PSC and has no impact on disease course and outcome. [...] However, there is no contraindication for anti-TNF therapy of concomitant active IBD in this group of patients. [...] Infliximab is proven to be effective in treatment of PG, but there is still not enough evidence on efficacy of anti-TNF drugs in treatment of EN and other rare skin manifestations of IBD. [...] According to guidelines of American Gastroenterology Association (AGA), in group of patients with CD, infliximab is indicated in treatment of spondyloarthropathies, arthritis, arthralgia, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, uveitis and other ophthalmological manifestations of IBD except optical neuritis which can worse or be consequence of anti-TNF treatment. [...] Anti-TNF drugs are proven to be effective and indicated only for treatment of perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease.","Although the pathogenesis is still not well understood, it is clear that PG is associated with the upregulation of several cytokines including interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β, IL-6, and interferon gamma, among many others. [...] TNF and IL-1β are of particular interest, because some biologic medications that target these cytokines have been effective in treating PG. [...] Anti-TNF agents and IVIG represent a significant advancement in treatment options.","TNF antibody therapy is an important treatment option for EIM in IBD patients whereas no such beneficial effect was reported for alpha 4 beta 7 integrin antibodies such as vedolizumab so far. [...] This article reviews the therapeutic experience with TNF antibodies for the treatment of EIM in IBD patients.","We provide a systematic overview about PASH syndrome and suggest a novel multimodal therapeutic regimen beyond isolated inhibition of TNF or IL-1.","In addition to classic immunosuppressive medications, PG has been reported to respond well to the anti-TNF agents, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab.","In autoinflammatory syndromes featuring neutrophilic dermatosis, the role of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of neutrophilic dermatosis has supported their classification as autoinflammatory diseases.

[...] This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNF-alpha inhibitors used for off-label dermatological indications. [...] We retrospectively evaluated patient records of 118 patients treated off-label with TNF-alpha inhibitors in a dermatological university department. [...] A significant number of these patients went into remission during therapy with TNF-alpha inhibitors. [...] Off-label therapy with TNF-alpha inhibitors may be considered for selected patients with severe recalcitrant mucocutaneous diseases. [...] The risk of severe adverse effects signals that a thorough benefit-risk assessment should be performed before initiating off-label treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitors for these conditions.","Cyclosporine is used in 74 %, TNF-α inhibitors in 24 %, and azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil each in 20 % of patients.","Successful therapy involving monoclonal antibodies seems to favor an autoimmune etiopathogenesis that has disorders of neutrophils' chemotactic activity and interleukins, which are acted upon by TNF-α cytokines.","Certolizumab pegol could be an alternative therapy in the treatment of PG in case of intolerance or ineffectiveness of the other anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies.","Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels were within normal limits.","Currently, anti-TNF is a promising treatment for refractory PG.","The therapeutic benefits of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-α) inhibitors have been reported in patients with refractory PG or HS.","The main monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes are familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), Blau syndrome, and pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome.","The main monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes are familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), Blau syndrome, and syndrome of pyogenic arthritis with pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA).","Secretion pattern of IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-α was assessed in supernatants by ELISA. [...] Patients with a history of osteoarticular flares release more IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α compared with those with predominant cutaneous recurrences.","In recent years, tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, such as infliximab and adalimumab, were reported to be effective for PG associated with IBD. [...] These drugs block the biological activity of TNF-α, which effects regulatory T cells, restoring their capacity to inhibit cytokine production. [...] The TNF-α inhibitors thus suppress the inflammatory processes that is involved in the pathogenesis of PG (11).","Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome is associated with mutations in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1A (TNFRSF1A) gene which decreases the level of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) leading to neutralization of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α.","Based on the pathogenesis of inflammation, we can suggest that an ideal targeted therapy should be able to induce the following changes: 1) reduction of the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1a/b from the inflammasome with subsequent blocking of its biological effect (by therapy with IL-1 receptor antagonists); 2) blocking of the activation of the secreted procytokines in their active form (by therapy with caspase-1 inhibitors; 3) blocking of the effect of the already released active cytokines (by therapy with tumour necrosis factor alpha, TNF-α, inhibitors); 4) blocking of the effector action of the cytokines on the target intracellular molecules (by therapy with kinase inhibitors). [...] Most surely, this could be achieved with combined therapy with different groups of biological agents (for example a combined therapy with IL-1 receptor antagonist and a TNF-α inhibitor).","Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists achieved complete response for pyoderma gangrenosum in 21%-25% of patients in interventional studies and in 92%-100% patients in non-interventional studies, with similar results for other cutaneous manifestations such as erythema nodosum or stomatitis. [...] In 2 non-interventional studies, anti-TNF therapy improved anemia in the short-term (67%) and in the long-term (34%). [...] Complete response after anti-TNF treatment was reported in interventional studies, including arthralgia (reduction in prevalence from 47.1% to 26.8% in the mid-term in 1 open label trial) and arthritis (reduction in prevalence from 8.7% to 2.1% and from 58% to 12.5% in 2 open label trials). [...] Anti-TNFs were beneficial for a majority of patients with ocular manifestations. [...] Anti-TNFs appear to be effective alternatives for certain EIMs associated with IBD including musculoskeletal, cutaneous, and ocular manifestations, and some beneficial effect may be obtained in metabolic bone disease and on hematologic or vascular EIMs.","A controlled trial on infliximab in PG points to efficacy of TNF-alpha antagonists.","This report details the case of a 17-month old boy with refractory multifocal pyoderma gangrenosum responsive to anti-TNF therapy.","It is rarely described in hyper IgD with periodic fever syndrome, cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes, TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome, deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and pyoderma gangrenosum and acne syndrome.","Common skin manifestations with a strong association to TNF antagonists are local injection site reactions, psoriasiform lesions, cutaneous infections, vasculitides and lupus-like syndromes. [...] In addition, we discuss the relation of thiopurines and TNF antagonists with the risk of skin cancer.","This review showed that the main monogenic auto-inflammatory syndromes are familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), Blau syndrome, TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), and pyogenic arthritis with pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA).","It includes systemic steroids, corticosteroid sparing agents such as dapsone and cyclosporine, and TNF-alpha inhibitors such as adalimumab and infliximab.","As these debilitating entities are all associated with the over-expression of IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, biological drugs specifically targeting these cytokines are currently the most effective treatments but, given the emerging role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of these syndromes, IL-17 antagonists may represent the future management of these conditions.","Here, we report a woman in her 40s with a disseminated corticodependent PG, resistant to any treatment attempted, including anti-tumoral necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in which bortezomib-dexamethasone regimen results in dramatic healing of all lesions in only a month.","In ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, cytapheresis depletes elevated and activated leucocytes, which are known to release inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. [...] The efficacy rates in subgroups on concomitant corticosteroid, anti-TNF or tacrolimus, and those without concomitant medications were not significantly different (P > 0.05).","The pathophysiology of EIMs remains elusive, although data from clinical trials demonstrating anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) efficacy suggest a common pathogenic link between intestinal and extraintestinal disease activity. [...] Anti-TNF-induced skin reactions are a new, but increasingly recognized phenomenon, which can be eventually misinterpreted as psoriatic lesions. [...] However, increasing evidence for anti-TNF agents' efficacy in EIM management has changed the approach to complicating and debilitating disease courses. [...] In the case of anti-TNF-induced lesions, topical steroids are usually sufficient and discontinuation of anti-TNF is seldom warranted.","An increasing body of evidence supports the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-17 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the pathophysiology of neutrophilic diseases similarly to classic monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, suggesting common physiopathological mechanisms.","Paradoxical reactions were initially described as isolated case reports or case series in patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α agents, first in inflammatory rheumatic diseases, later in psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. [...] The underlying pathomechanism in these complex diseases with involvement of multiple immunological pathways is most likely a cytokine imbalance, and substitution of the anti-TNFα agent by an alternative anti-p40 or anti-IL-17A biologic may be extremely helpful.","Efficacy of anti-TNF agents suggests TNF-dependent mechanisms. [...] We performed immunohistochemistry for TNFα, NFκB, STAT1/STAT3, MAdCAM1, CD20/68, caspase 3/9, IFNγ, and Hsp-27/70 on 240 intestinal [55 controls, 185 IBD] and 64 skin biopsies [11 controls, 18 erythema nodosum [EN], 13 pyoderma gangenosum [PG], 22 psoriasis]. [...] TNFα was upregulated in intestinal biopsies from active Crohn`s disease [CD] vs controls [36.2 vs 12.1, p < 0.001], but not ulcerative colitis [UC: 17.9]. [...] TNFα and NFκB were overexpressed in skin biopsies from EN, PG, and psoriasis. [...] Upregulation of TNFα/NFκB in EN and PG is compatible with the efficacy of anti-TNF in EIM management.","Increased levels of inflammatory mediators including IL-1β, IL-8, IL-17, and TNF-α contribute to the development of the disease but there are still several unknown factors, including the trigger for immune dysregulation and additional contributory components of the immune system.","This study compared incidence rates of EIMs in patients with moderate to severe IBD receiving gut-selective vedolizumab (VDZ) vs those receiving systemic anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies. [...] Adult IBD patients receiving VDZ or anti-TNFs were identified from the MarketScan claims database from September 28, 2012, through September 30, 2016. [...] Compared with patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, VDZ-treated CD patients were 28% more likely to develop \"any EIMs\" (adjusted incident rate ratio [IRR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.62). [...] UC patients receiving VDZ did not have a statistically significant increase in \"any EIMs\" vs patients receiving anti-TNFs, but were more likely to develop specific EIMs (aphthous stomatitis: IRR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.30-10.34; pyoderma gangrenosum: IRR, 4.42; 95% CI, 1.00-19.45; and PSC: IRR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.23-9.68). [...] IBD patients receiving VDZ may be more likely to develop EIMs vs patients receiving anti-TNF therapies.","Several biologic agents including anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) drugs, anti-integrins, and antibodies to the p40 subunit of IL12/23 are approved for induction and maintenance of remission of IBD. [...] Potential side effects of anti-TNF-α drugs such as serious infections, malignancy, worsening of heart failure, and infusion-related reactions should be considered prior to starting these drugs. [...] Anti-TNF-α drugs with or without immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) are often used for the induction and maintenance of remission.","In external ear, the more common manifestations of IBD are pyoderma gangrenosum, metastatic Crohn's disease and relapsing polychondritis and the treatment includes corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents. [...] Initial therapy is usually steroids, with a step up to anti-TNF-a therapy and cochlear implantations with failure of treatment.","We aimed to summarize currently available data on the use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists in the management of PASH syndrome and report on our own experience with the use of adalimumab in a patient presenting with this specific constellation of clinical signs and symptoms. [...] In summary, TNF antagonists are a promising treatment for PASH; however, conclusions regarding the choice of a specific agent, optimal dosing or use in combination with other treatment modalities cannot yet be drawn.","Although mucosal healing reduces the risk of colectomy, whether or not early treatment of patients with 'high-risk' features using tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists reduces the risk of colectomy is not clear. [...] Treatment discordance was defined as treating 'high-risk' patients with medications other than anti-TNF therapy during the first 6 months after diagnosis or treating 'low-risk' patients with anti-TNF therapy within 6 months of diagnosis.","TNF-alpha inhibitor infliximab was reported to be efficient in treatment of PPG refractory to systemic corticosteroids.","As an indicator of more intensive intestinal disease activity, patients with cutaneous manifestations of IBD needed more frequently therapy with antibiotics, steroids, immunomodulators and anti-TNF. [...] Multivariate analysis revealed female gender, younger age at diagnosis and presence of other extraintestinal manifestations as factors being associated with skin EIM in IBD patients and anti-TNF as well as immunomodulatory treatment in CD patients.","Recently, another clinical issue regarding skin lesions in patients with IBD, a so-called paradoxical reaction, during the treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents has emerged. [...] These reactions are termed paradoxical reactions because the skin lesions sometimes resemble psoriasis, although the anti-TNF-α agents have been historically used to treat psoriasis. [...] Paradoxical reactions are reportedly found in approximately 5-10% of patients using anti-TNF-α agents and are no longer rare.","The efficacy and tolerability of biological agents, from the initial tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors to the new anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies, have dramatically changed the natural history of debilitating conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and seronegative spondyloarthropathies. [...] TNF-α antagonist-induced psoriasis, which can manifest de novo or as exacerbation of a pre-existing form, is the prototypic and most frequent paradoxical skin reaction to biologics while other reactions, such as eczematous and lichenoid eruptions, hidradenitis suppurativa, pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome and granulomatous skin diseases, occur much more rarely.","TNF-α blockers are also effective in the latter conditions but seem of particular value in granulomatous (e.g., granuloma annulare) and neutrophilic disorders (e.g., pyoderma gangrenosum). [...] Overall, disappointing results of TNF-α blockers in alopecia areata and vitiligo point to the same conclusion although promising results in toxic epidermal necrolysis suggest TNF-α exerts at least some in vivo Th1-related activities.","The aim was to report on whether cutaneous lesions associated with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and refractory to standard medical therapy including anti-tumour necrosis factors [anti-TNFs], would respond to the newer biologic agents ustekinumab [UST] or vedolizumab [VDZ]. [...] This report includes 28 patients with cutaneous lesions from 14 centres, all of whom had failed immunomodulator and anti-TNF therapy.","Due to deeper insights into pathogenesis and growing clinical reports, a broader utilization of biologic treatments and a shift from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha to interleukin (IL)-12/23 or IL-23 antibodies alone are predictable, as IL-12/23 antibodies show good clinical responses with fewer side effects.","Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) inhibitors have had a significant impact in medicine since the approval of the first drug of its class by the US FDA in 1998. [...] New clinical data and indications have emerged for TNF inhibitors in recent years. [...] Currently, four TNF inhibitors have been approved by the US FDA for dermatology, two of which include US FDA-approved pediatric use. [...] In addition, there have been clinical reports on the use of TNF inhibitors to treat a variety of other pediatric dermatologic conditions. [...] To help clinicians keep pace with the new data provided by many pediatric dermatology studies involving TNF inhibitors, this review provides an overview of the use of TNF inhibitors in the treatment of pediatric plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Kawasaki disease. [...] For TNF inhibitors with little data in the pediatric population, data on adult use is discussed.","Higher rates of complete resolution were reported with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents (63%) and surgical interventions (80%). [...] Most PPG cases resolved after treatment with the highest rates of complete resolution seen with anti-TNF agents and surgical intervention.","Systemic corticosteroids, a number of immunosuppressants and biologics, such as interleukin (IL)-1 antagonists and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α inhibitors, are nowadays therapy for these diseases.","Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was strongly detected in giant cells.","Treatment of PG typically starts with fast-acting immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids and/or cyclosporine) to reduce inflammation followed by the addition of more slowly acting immunosuppressive drugs with superior adverse event profiles, including biologics (in particular, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents).","As expected, TNF involvement is noted in CD, UC, PSC, and arthritis.","The response to targeted therapy was evaluated by comparing the inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) and serum cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) before and after biological agents treatment. [...] Before treatment, the CRP (256 mg/L), ESR (105 mm/1 h) and cytokines including serum TNF-α (7.43 ng/L), IL-1 (<5 ng/L), IL-6 (301 ng/L) were significantly elevated. [...] Besides, the level of CRP, ESR, serum TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 were all decreased to normal on the last followed up in December 2019.","Many EIMs independent of intestinal disease activity can be successfully treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. [...] Its postulated role in the development of de novo EIMs is heavily confounded by the high proportion of patients previously exposed to TNF antagonists; new EIMs could result from TNF antagonist treatment cessation rather than being caused by vedolizumab.","In addition, ustekinumab may show efficacy in treating paradoxical cutaneous reactions to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors. [...] It is also an effective treatment for TNF-α inhibitor-induced paradoxical skin reactions, such as, psoriasis that do not remit spontaneously or with conventional treatment.","Although prednisolone, granulocyte/monocyte apheresis, calcineurin inhibitor and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy are generally used, no treatment strategy for inflammatory bowel disease complicated with pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) has been established yet. [...] We conclude that anti-TNF-α antibodies might be selected as the first choice when PG and UC are refractory to treatment, and a switch to anti-TNFs should be considered when the effect is still insufficient.","The use of TNF-α inhibitor, removal of necrotic tissue, and skin grafting may promote epithelialization.","Anti-TNF-α and anti-IL-1a blockade are between the therapeutic approaches that improve skin symptoms and prevent permanent osteoarticular damage.","Trials with immunomodulatory therapy elucidate the role of specific immune pathways and cytokine signaling in disease mechanism, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, and complement.","TNF-a inhibitors, which include adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, certolizumab, and golimumab, and IL-12/23 inhibitor, ustekinumab, have been widely used as a U.S. [...] Outside of psoriasis, high levels of TNF-a had also been found in several skin diseases including hidradenitis suppurativa. [...] This paper reviews the off-label uses of TNF-a inhibitors and IL-12/23 inhibitors in skin disorders.","Of the included patients, 71.9% (n = 41/57) noted PG onset after initiating rituximab, 21.1% (n = 12/57) noted tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) inhibitors, 5.3% (n = 3/57) reported interleukin 17A inhibitors, and 1.8% (n = 1/57) reported cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 antibodies. [...] Complete resolution of PG in TNF-α-associated cases occurred within an average of 2.2 months after switching to another TNF-α inhibitor (n = 1), an interleukin 12/23 inhibitor (n = 2), or treatment with systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine (n = 3), systemic corticosteroids alone (n = 1), or cyclosporine alone (n = 1). [...] Nevertheless, PG may develop in patients on rituximab or TNF-α inhibitors, suggesting the need to monitor and treat such adverse effects.","Each of these uncommon presentations of acute leukemia has a unique impact on patient management.","In minimally invasive or cosmetic surgery these aspects may have a forensic impact, as pyoderma gangrenosum heals with atrophic scars.","Acne inversa is a chronic disease with a major impact on the quality of life.","The impact on pregnancy appears to be limited.","CSA efficacy was excellent, with an early response and acceptable toxicity, although it did not seem to have any impact on the incidence of PG recurrences.","The importance of prevention and the impact of having access to knowledgeable care providers cannot be over-emphasized.","In addition, it has an impact on the skin lesions observed in diabetes, lupus, and AIDS.","IGIV has had a major impact in neurology, haematology, immunology, rheumatology and dermatology.","The EIMs associated with IBD bear a negative impact on patients with UC and CD.","Furthermore, it is expected that future studies should explore the possible roles of the synergistic interactions between antioxidants and cytokines and their impact on the Th1/Th2 cytokine networks balances.","Disease course and the impact of disease severity on growth according to gender in pediatric Crohn disease require prospective study.","The association of hidradenitis suppurativa with inflammatory bowel disease permitted the opportunity to utilize infliximab and to observe not only its impact on the bowel, but also skin. [...] Infliximab dramatically and favorably impacted on three cases of hidradenitis, but also in one of the patients who also had pyoderma gangrenosum.","The EIMs associated with IBD have a negative impact on patients with UC and CD, and the resolution of most of them parallels that of the active IBD in terms of timing and required therapy; however, the clinical course of EIMs such as axial arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis is independent of IBD activity.","This clinicotherapeutic classification seems to work well in PG, although its impact on the incidence of relapses is poorly evaluable due to the short follow-ups in our study; controlled trials are needed to confirm its value.","Whether the impact of changing treatment paradigms with increased use of immunosuppressives and biologic agents can reduce disease complications and associated conditions is unknown.","The authors present a review of neutrophilic dermatoses that have great impact on the health of patients: Sweet syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, Behçet's disease and neutrophilic urticaria.","Extraintestinal manifestations are observed in 20-40% of patients and frequently have a negative impact on quality of patients' life.","The authors present a patient with a recalcitrant PG that did not respond to systemic standard therapies, and discuss further treatment options with impact on quality of life.","Aim of the study was to investigate the impact of TNF-α antagonists on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in selected skin diseases, i.e. chronic plaque psoriasis, Behçet's disease (BD), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG).

[...] Three months later, despite regression of the EED lesions under dapsone, two large pustules appeared on the outer aspect of the right leg; they were confluent and progressed towards a superficial ulcer with rounded edges with a clinical appearance evocative of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). [...] We report for the first time the association of two forms of neutrophilic dermatosis, EED and PG, in an HIV-positive patient.","Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a rare dermatosis characterized by reddish-violaceous to browning papulonodular and plaques and belongs to the spectrum of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. [...] A 55-year-old woman with a history of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) presented successively with two rare forms of ND, namely, EED and CRAND. [...] Our observation is important because it reports two rare entities, CRAND and EED.","We have found a B2 repeat insertion in the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 6 (PTPN6) in a mouse that developed a skin disorder with clinical and histopathological features resembling those seen in human neutrophilic dermatoses. [...] Therefore, we tested the cDNA and genomic DNA sequences of PTPN6 from patients with Sweet's syndrome (SW) and pyoderma gangrenosum and found numerous novel splice variants in different combinations. [...] These isoforms were associated with a heterozygous E441G mutation and a heterozygous 1.7-kbp deletion in the promoter region of the PTPN6 gene. [...] Although full-length PTPN6 was detected in all other patients with either pyoderma gangrenosum or SW, it was always associated with splice variants: a partial deletion of exon 4 with the complete deletion of exon 5, alterations that were not detected in healthy controls. [...] The defect in transcriptional regulation of the hematopoietic PTPN6 appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of certain subsets of the heterogeneous group of neutrophilic dermatoses.","Irradiated syngeneic wild-type mice developed the same neutrophilic dermatosis-like disease (NDLD) after adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from Ptpn6(meb2/meb2) mutant mice. [...] To analyze differentially expressed genes in the bone marrow of mice with NDLD to gain insight into the role of Ptpn6 in myelopoietic bone marrow pathology, and the mechanisms by which Ptpn6 insufficiency in the hematopoietic cells can lead to the development of skin lesions. [...] As Ptpn6 is involved in a myriad of signaling pathways, we used a global approach with microarray technology for the first time to characterize changes in the bone marrow and skin of motheaten-type mice. [...] From 503 genes encoding proteins with ITIM motif that binds to Ptpn6, 109 were up-regulated and 83 were down-regulated.","The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of adalimumab (ADA) for the treatment of EIM in patients with CD. forty two consecutive CD patients with at least one EIM were prospectively included in a open-label study. [...] Patients received ADA (160 mg at week zero, 80 mg at week two and 40 mg every other week) over six months and the effectiveness and safety of ADA for EIMs were assessed. [...] No relationship was found between sex, tobacco, family history of IBD, phenotype and previous treatment with anti-TNF, and EIM resolution. adalimumab is effective in reducing EIM of CD.","After 2 weeks, adalimumab (ADA) induced remission; however, his UC and PG relapsed 20 weeks later. [...] As a result of switching to infliximab, since a loss of response to ADA was deemed to have occurred, remission was reintroduced and subsequently maintained for 40 weeks.","Recently, adalimumab (ADA), a fully human monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor, was approved for refractory PG treatment in Japan. [...] Although adding a moderate dose of glucocorticoid did not improve her PG, the patient showed a remarkable response after switching from etanercept to ADA in a higher dose than that used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. [...] This higher dose of ADA may be effective for the treatment of refractory PG after the failure of another tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.","Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms are associated with thrombophilia and vasculopathy that may result in cutaneous ulceration. [...] We describe 2 patients with MTHFR polymorphisms discovered during hypercoagulable evaluation for cutaneous ulcerations on the lower extremities. [...] MTHFR polymorphisms should be part of a comprehensive laboratory evaluation during hypercoagulable workup. [...] Vitamin supplementation with folic acid (B(9)), pyridoxine hydrochloride (B(6)), and cyanocobalamin (B(12)) may result in healing of cutaneous ulcerations in some patients with MTHFR mutations.","Two patients had mutations in MTHFR and two had mutations in JAK2. [...] For example, treatment with B vitamins improved PG in cases of mutations in MTHFR, whereas patients with myelodysplastic syndrome improved with thalidomide treatment.","Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG)-like ulcerations are a rare clinical manifestation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation. [...] When referred to our dermatology centre, on investigation, it was discovered that she has an MTHFR mutation.","Several skin diseases associated with immune disorders may be related to the formation of circulating immune complexes (CIC) and their skin deposition. [...] Sera from 20 controls and 108 patients, including: 23 psoriasis, 10 lichen planus, 30 atopic eczemas, 32 cases of leprosy, 10 vasculitis and 3 pyoderma gangrenosum were evaluated for the presence of IgG-containing CIC by the microconsumption complement test (MCT). [...] Additionally, the presence of IgE-containing CIC by means of a polyethylene glycol precipitation and radioimmunoassay technique was evaluated in 10 patients with atopic eczema. [...] It was found that 56.5% of psoriatic patients show moderate CIC concentrations, as well as 34% of leprosy patients, with increased levels when bacillus were detected in skin lesions, and in 90% of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. [...] A close relationship between CIC levels and the clinical evolution of skin lesions was demonstrated in patients with pyoderma gangrenosum and lichen planus. [...] IgG-CIC were detected in 33% and IgE-CIC in 30% of patients with atopic eczema, with the presence of both types of CIC in 2 out of 3 cases. [...] The systematic research on CIC presence in some selected skin diseases shows that immune complexes take part, with different degrees of relevance, in the pathogenesis of all the entities.","Thirty-three children diagnosed with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a single institution over an 8 year period were evaluated with special emphasis on children who presented with extramedullary disease (EMD). [...] EMD was present at diagnosis in 12 (36%) of the 33 children with MDS. [...] Dramatic improvement of EMD and decrease in blast cells both in the peripheral blood and bone marrow were obtained following administration of short-course HDMP treatment alone as observed in children with AML. [...] Remission was achieved in 8 (80%) of 10 children who presented with EMD and in 9 (60%) of 15 children without EMD. [...] Long-term remission (>6 years) was obtained in 4 (two with JMML and two with CMML), three of whom presented with EMD. [...] In conclusion EMD can be a presenting finding in childhood MDS as observed in adults.","This study describes the feasibility of adding some biochemical and immunohistochemical parameters to increase the objectivity and specificity of the wound bed score Method: Patients with chronic wounds on the lower leg with different durations were enrolled to assess the correlation between the wound bed score and specific wound-related biomarkers, namely MMP-9, MMP-2, NGAL, albumin, integrin α2/β1, and other histochemical (CD68, PK1, CD32, fractalkine, periostin) and immunocytochemical markers from biopsies and smears taken from wound edges and bed. [...] CD68 PK1 showed a low or negative expression in the majority of the samples. [...] Patients negative for CD68 PK1 were also negative for CD32.","Caspase 3 and CD68 overexpression in skin biopsies distinguished EN/PG from psoriasis and controls.","Samples were analysed by immunofluorescence using three biomarkers, interleukin (IL)-17E, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase1, each one in combination with two cell markers, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD68, which allow the identification of neutrophils and macrophages, respectively. [...] The analysis of ND by immunofluorescence using IL-17E, iNOS and arginase1 in combination with MPO and CD68 allows for characterization of differential expression patterns in the epidermis as well as the determination of the polarization status of the dermal neutrophils and macrophages.","In addition, high numbers of CD11c+ CD68+ pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages were detected in the dermis, significantly extending the numbers seen in venous leg ulcers.","Currently, the database contains 291 sequence variants in related genes (MEFV, TNFRSF1A, MVK, CARD15, PSTPIP1, and CIAS1), consisting of published data and personal communications, which has revealed or refined the preferential mutational sites for each gene.","DNA samples from 97 patients with BD and 51 matched healthy controls were analysed for the mevalonate kinase (MVK), cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome 1 (CIAS1) and proline/serine/threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) genes, responsible for mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome, respectively. [...] Two patients had paired mutations in the MVK gene (genotypes V377I/V377I and V377I/S135L) and displayed typical features of BD and MKD. [...] This study could not demonstrate any significant increases in MVK, CIAS1 or PSTPIP1 mutations in patients with BD as compared with controls.","The role of an established biochemical pathway in regulating inflammation was uncovered by the discovery that the hyperimmunoglobulin D with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) results from mutations in MVK, which encodes an enzyme in the isoprenoid pathway.","Hyperimmunoglublinemia D syndrome is caused by mevalonate kinase (MVK) deficiency, which may be affected by protein accumulation that leads to NALP3 inflammasome activation.","Genome-wide association (GWA) studies recently identified a novel gene, TRAF3IP2, involved in the susceptibility to psoriasis. [...] We therefore aimed to assess the role of TRAF3IP2 gene in IBD, with particular regard to the development of cutaneous extraintestinal manifestations (pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum). [...] Three TRAF3IP2 SNPs were genotyped by allelic discrimination assays. [...] Moreover, association of TRAF3IP2 variants with ileal (OR=1.92), fibrostricturing (OR=1.91) and perianal CD (OR=2.03) was observed. [...] This is the first preliminary report indicating that TRAF3IP2 variants increase the risk of cutaneous extraintestinal manifestations in IBD suggesting that the analysis of the TRAF3IP2 variants may be useful for identifying IBD patients at risk to develop these manifestations.","Activated protein C (APC) stimulates wound healing in patients with treatment-refractory skin ulcers, possibly by stimulating angiogenesis and re-epithelialization, and preventing inflammation. [...] To investigate whether APC may be beneficial as a treatment for ulcers related to cutaneous PG. [...] A total of 400 μg (1.0 mL) of APC was injected subcutaneously into the dermal edge of necrotic PG ulcers weekly for a total treatment period of 6 weeks. [...] Over the 12 weeks of the trial, APC led to a reduction in wound size from 3.8 cm(2) to 0.8 cm(2) in patient 1 (78.9% decrease) and from 41 cm(2) to 16 cm(2) in patient 2 (70.0% decrease, respectively), and a reduction in pain scores from 10 to 0 (100% decrease) in both patients. [...] Although this study has limited because of its small sample size and lack of a true placebo group, it does indicate that APC has potential as a therapeutic option for patients with chronic skin ulcers from PG.","Between 2004 and 2010, seven patients with PG were admitted to our burn treatment center (BTC). [...] An institutional review board-approved retrospective study investigated seven PG BTC admissions. [...] The average symptom onset was 70.5 days prior to BTC admission. [...] The BTC wound care lasted 24 days. [...] Prompt diagnosis and BTC specialized care greatly improve outcomes for PG patients.","Fas/Fas ligand and CD40/CD40 ligand systems were over-expressed in PG (P = 0·0001 for Fas, P = 0·009 for Fas ligand, P = 0·012 for CD40, P = 0·0001 for CD40 ligand), contributing to tissue damage and inflammation, while their role seems to be less significant in SS.","Fas/Fas ligand and cluster of differentiation (CD)40/CD40 ligand systems were also overexpressed (P = 0.016 for Fas, P = 0.006 for Fas ligand, P = 0.005 for CD40, and P = 0.004 for CD40 ligand), contributing to tissue damage and inflammation.","Therefore, 15 patients with PG, five with Sweet's syndrome (SS) and nine skin specimens from healthy controls (HC) were investigated, evaluating the expression of Th1-related markers interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-γ, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) and C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), of the Th2-related molecules IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and CCR3, of the co-stimulatory axis CD40/CD40 ligand, of IL-15 and the natural killer (NK) cell marker CD56 in skin lesions by immunohistochemistry. [...] Both CD40 and CD40L were expressed more in PG than in SS and HC (P < 0·0001 for both). [...] At the same time, over-expression of the co-stimulatory axis CD40/CD40L amplifies the impairment of the Th1/Th2 balance.","We studied 21 patients with PG, eight with Sweet's syndrome and 20 controls, evaluating skin immunoreactivity for inflammatory cell markers (CD3, CD163 and myeloperoxidase), cytokines [tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-17], metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). [...] Immunoreactivities of CD3, CD163, myeloperoxidase, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-17, MMP-2, MMP-9 and VEGF were significantly higher in both PG and Sweet's syndrome than in controls (P=0·0001).

[...] The epidermis carried in all ISDs, except for CLE, a strong JAK3 signature. [...] JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 were significantly overexpressed in PG and AD suggesting the need for pan-JAK inhibitors. [...] In contrast, psoriasis and LP showed only JAK1 and JAK3 upregulation, while AA and CLE were characterized by a single dermal JAK signal (pJAK3 and pJAK1, respectively). [...] Considering the epidermal JAK3 expression levels, great interest should go to the investigation of topical JAK3 inhibitors as therapeutic option of ISDs.","NOD2, the Blau syndrome protein, shares certain domains with cryopyrin and appears to be a sensor of intracellular bacteria.","Patients with PASH have recently been reported to present alterations of genes involved in well-known autoinflammatory diseases, such as PSTPIP1, MEFV, NOD2 and NLRP3.","Cases of PG and PASH showed mutations in the autoinflammatory genes MEFV, NLRP3, NLRP12, NOD2, LPIN2 and PSTPIP1.","A mutation in in the NOD2 (\"nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing protein 2\") gene could not be detected in any of the three persons affected.","Four PASH patients who had also gut inflammation showed three different variants in NOD2 gene, two variants in OTULIN, and a variant in GJB2, respectively.","We report a case of HS in a 22-year-old man with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), a developmental disorder caused by a chromosomal 17 microdeletion. [...] Obesity and a tendency toward follicular occlusion are features of SMS that may have contributed to the development of HS in our patient. [...] Dermatologic findings in SMS have been characterized in the literature in the past, but to our knowledge, this is the first case of HS reported in a patient with SMS.","The question of whether solid malignancies (SMs) are associated with pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) remains to be conclusively answered.","The B box segment of pyrin was necessary and the B box/coiled-coil segment sufficient for this interaction, whereas the SH3 and coiled-coil domains of PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 were both necessary, but neither was sufficient, for pyrin binding.","To obliterate the aneurysm and prevent rupture, the patient underwent coil embolization via an endovascular approach under general anesthesia because the procedure under sedation with local anesthesia was too risky for re-bleeding.

[...] Skin manifestations are encountered in nearly half of the patients with WG, thus it is important to be familiar with cutaneous histopathologic as well as immunofluorescence findings in WG patients.","Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the antithyroid drug most frequently implicated in ANCA-associated diseases specifically involving anti-myeloperoxidase ANCA (MPO-ANCA).","Herein, we report a similar case of myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) positivity. [...] This patient had PAPASH syndrome with colitis and was MPO-ANCA and anticardiolipin antibodies-positive; it is unclear whether these antibodies play a role in this disease, but it may provide clues to further elucidate its pathogenesis.","Migration, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), release of myeloperoxidase (MPO), and NETosis are functional immunological reactions of elementary importance for polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). [...] Agarose had an inhibitory effect on MPO release and fibrin a retarding effect on NETosis. [...] Because of the high abundance of type III collagen in lung and skin matrices, the interaction of PMN with the respective matrix could be an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum.","Samples were analysed by immunofluorescence using three biomarkers, interleukin (IL)-17E, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase1, each one in combination with two cell markers, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD68, which allow the identification of neutrophils and macrophages, respectively. [...] The analysis of ND by immunofluorescence using IL-17E, iNOS and arginase1 in combination with MPO and CD68 allows for characterization of differential expression patterns in the epidermis as well as the determination of the polarization status of the dermal neutrophils and macrophages.","First, nicastrin (NCSTN) and PSTPIP1 mutations are directly associated with auto-inflammatory disease.","Although its precise pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown, I herein emphasize the importance of the following three recent discoveries in the pathogenesis of HS: First, heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding γ-secretase, including NCSTN, PSENEN, and PSEN1, have been identified in some patients with HS. [...] Furthermore, Psen1-/Psen2-, Psen1-, Ncstn+/-, and Notch1-/Notch2- mice share common phenotypes of human HS, suggesting a role of aberrant keratinization in the development of HS.","These different clinical entities include PAPA (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne conglobata), PASH (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne and suppurative hidradenitis), PAPASH (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, suppurative hidradenitis and pyogenic arthritis), PsAPASH (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, suppurative hidradenitis and psoriatic arthritis), PASS (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne conglobata, suppurative hidradenitis, and axial spondyloarthritis) and PAC (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne and ulcerative colitis), which can be distinguished by their clinical presentation and the presence or absence of mutations in several genes, such as the genes encoding proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1), nicastrin (NCSTN), Mediterranean fever (MEFV) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD).","Three PAPASH and three PASH/SAPHO overlapping patients who had also joint inflammation showed two different variants in NCSTN, one in WDR1 and PSTPIP1, and two variants in NLRC4, one of whom was present in a patient with a mixed phenotype characterized by gut and joint inflammation.","Autoinflammatory phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2)-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (APLAID) is a rare autoinflammatory disease caused by gain-of-function mutations in the PLCG2 gene.

[...] CD2BP1 and its murine ortholog, proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein (PSTPIP1), are adaptor proteins known to interact with PEST-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). [...] Previous evidence supports the integral role of CD2BP1 and its interacting proteins in actin reorganization during cytoskeletal-mediated events. [...] This CD2BP1-mediated biochemical pathway(s) may function in common inflammatory disorders with apparent etiological overlap, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.","We now show that proline serine threonine phosphatase-interacting protein [PSTPIP1, or CD2-binding protein 1 (CD2BP1)], a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein involved in cytoskeletal organization, also interacts with pyrin. [...] Recently, PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 mutations were shown to cause the syndrome of pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA), a dominantly inherited autoinflammatory disorder mediated predominantly by granulocytes. [...] Endogenous PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 and pyrin are coexpressed in monocytes and granulocytes and can be coimmunoprecipitated from THP-1 cells. [...] The B box segment of pyrin was necessary and the B box/coiled-coil segment sufficient for this interaction, whereas the SH3 and coiled-coil domains of PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 were both necessary, but neither was sufficient, for pyrin binding. [...] The Y344F PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 mutation, which blocks tyrosine phosphorylation, was associated with a marked reduction in pyrin binding in pervanadate-treated cells. [...] PAPA-associated A230T and E250Q PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 mutations markedly increased pyrin binding as assayed by immunoprecipitation and, relative to WT, these mutants were hyperphosphorylated when coexpressed with c-Abl kinase. [...] Consistent with the hypothesis that these mutations exert a dominant-negative effect on the previously reported activity of pyrin, we found increased IL-1beta production by peripheral blood leukocytes from a clinically active PAPA patient with the A230T PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 mutation and in cell lines transfected with both PAPA-associated mutants.","Patients with the syndromic triad of pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne, an autoinflammatory process caused by mutations in the CD2 binding protein-1 (CD2BP1) gene, can have severe pyoderma gangrenosum.","Pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne syndrome is associated with mutations in the gene that encodes for CD2-binding protein 1 (CD2BP1), which binds pyrin.","PSTPIP1 inhibits T-cell activation upon T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 engagement, regardless of CD2 costimulation.","PAPA syndrome is caused by mutations on chromosome 15q affecting the proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) gene, also known as CD2-binding protein 1 (CD2BP1).","The typical immunohistochemical phenotype is, CD2 +ve, CD3 +ve, CD5 +ve, CD4 +ve, and CD8 - ve.","These early inflammatory events were dominated by increased gene expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, IL-8, IL-17, IFNG, and IL-36G and transcription factors consistent with Th1 phenotype.","Serum IL-18, IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), and CXCL9 levels were assessed by bead-based assay, and free IL-18 levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
